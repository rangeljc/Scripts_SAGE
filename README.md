# Scripts_SAGE
<p>SAGE is a SCADA/EMS high performance large system, developed and constantly updated by Cepel. It is used by many companies of generation,
  transmission and distribution of electric energy on Brazil, in special the Cepel founding companies (Chesf, Furnas, Eletronorte, and Eletrosul),
  as well as the National Electrical System Operator (Operador Nacional do Sistema Elétrico - ONS), on all their control centers.
  The modular architecture allows proper customization in order to be used as a communication gateway, as a data hub in a distribution system,
  as a local or regional supervision system, as a wide system operation center, or even as a “multi-site” system, composed by many synchronized and redundant control centers.</p>

<p>SAGE implements the Electrical System Data Acquisition, Processing and Distribution (SCADA) functions. It also provides support to Multiple Acquisition and Distribution Protocols.
  The Data Communication is performed by modules, all of them own developed, allowing the Connection with a variety of Field Equipments (IEDs, ­UTRs)
  and with Regional or System Wide Control Centers through Standard Protocols, such as OPC UA (IEC 62541), IEC 61850, ICCP (IEC 60870-6 TASE 2), IEEE C37.118, IEC 60870-5-104,
  IEC 60870-5-101, DNP 3.0 serial or TCP , Open-ModBus TCP, SNMP, and more.</p>
